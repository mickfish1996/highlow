# HILOW
A game that asks you to predict whether the next card is higher or lower than the current. It will 
draw a card the user guesses if it is higher or lower and if the are correct than they get
points, if they are wrong they have points taken away.

The Reason that I am choosing this is because it is a simple way to show class functionality in 
Java to allow me to learn the syntax for different executions of code.
